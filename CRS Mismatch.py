‚ùå # Incorrect Code (will likely fail or give wrong results):

‚úÖ # Correct Code:
import geopandas as gpd

# Load the layers
cities = gpd.read_file("cities.shp")     # EPSG:4326
roads = gpd.read_file("roads.shp")       # EPSG:32633

# Always check and align CRS using:
print(cities.crs)
print(roads.crs)
